This project is a homework assignment with the objective of learning how to do code refactoring from a previously published website.

Description of work:
1. Using an image of a mock-up web page, assets and source code, I refactored the source code to change the css from repetitive elements to a cleaner, more concise css file with semantic html.
2. Evaluate and remediate all accessibility issues, especially with alt-image tags.
3.

## User Story

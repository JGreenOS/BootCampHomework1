## Title: Refactor Code Project  aka BootCampHomework1

This project is has the objective of learning how to do code refactoring from a previously published website.

## Description of work:
1. Using an image of a mock-up web page, assets and source code, I refactored the source code to change the css from repetitive elements to a cleaner, more concise css file with semantic html.
2. Evaluate and remediate all accessibility issues, especially with alt-image tags.
3. Publish to github for review.

Final project is located at : https://jgreenos.github.io/BootCampHomework1/index.html

## Notes:
In this project, the use of a responsive framework is not allowed to help developers understand, demonstrate the relationship and use of html/css. Using a responsive framework will provide the end user with a much more robust experience.
If this project extends beyond a single page, a site index xml file is recommended.

## User Story:
A marketing agency, with experience in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), needed their site to respond to site crawlers.
The user requested a codebase with accessiblity standards and optimization for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

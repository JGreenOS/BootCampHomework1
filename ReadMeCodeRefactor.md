## Title: Refactor Code Project  aka BootCampHomework1

This project is a demonstration of code refactoring from a previously published website.

## Description of work:
1. Using an image of a mock-up web page, assets and source code, I refactored the source code to change the css from repetitive elements to a cleaner, more concise css file with semantic html.
2. Evaluate and remediate all accessibility issues, especially with alt-image tags.
3. Publish to github for review.

Final project is located at : https://jgreenos.github.io/BootCampHomework1/index.html

## Notes:
In this project, the use of a responsive framework is not allowed to help developers understand, demonstrate the relationship and use of html/css. Using a responsive framework will provide the end user with a much more robust experience.
If this project extends beyond a single page, a site index xml file is recommended.
After homework was completed, the working repo was changed to be more descriptive.  Commits completed during the development of the project 

## User Story:
A marketing agency, with experience in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), needed their site to respond to site crawlers.
The user requested a codebase with accessiblity standards and optimization for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

All acceptance criteria are met in the final project.

## Notes for followup for designer
The header, background of the left content and the background of the right side content (aside) are different shades of blue.  It is recommended to standardize the blue color to achieve a more pleasing visual effect.
 
The logo in the header, with the color change on the SEO in Horiseon could be more pronounced perhaps with a contrasting color to draw the user to the main focus of the company.

In the original source code there is a footer and copyright statement, however the mockup did not contain these elements.  See comments in html and css files for the specific technique used to suppress the footer from the final page.
